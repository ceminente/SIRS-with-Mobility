###  Description and Results
We investigated the role of mobility between two communities (represented by two networks) in the reintroduction of an otherwise disappered disease. 
In detail, we explored the role of the topology of the networks involved and of the main mobility parameter, the probability of mobility $\p_mob$.
We used two different metrics to echieve this result: the probability of extinction and the fraction of cumulative time spent as disease free.
The epidemic model we investigated is a stochastic SIRS with topology.
